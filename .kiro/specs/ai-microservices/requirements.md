# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves developing modular AI microservices using FastAPI backend and Next.js frontend, integrating with OpenAI API through OpenRouter. The system will provide three core AI functionalities: text summarization, Q&A over documents, and dynamic learning path suggestions. The application will be built as a microservices architecture with REST APIs and an optional frontend interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to access text summarization functionality through a REST API, so that I can integrate AI-powered summarization into my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a POST request to `/api/summarize` with text content THEN the system SHALL return a summarized version of the text
2. WHEN the text content exceeds token limits THEN the system SHALL handle chunking and return appropriate error messages
3. WHEN the API key is invalid or missing THEN the system SHALL return a 401 unauthorized error
4. WHEN the request is malformed THEN the system SHALL return a 400 bad request error with descriptive message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to perform Q&A operations over documents through a REST API, so that I can build intelligent document query systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a document and asks a question THEN the system SHALL return relevant answers based on document content
2. WHEN a user asks a question without providing a document THEN the system SHALL return an error indicating document is required
3. WHEN the document format is unsupported THEN the system SHALL return a 415 unsupported media type error
4. WHEN the question is empty or invalid THEN the system SHALL return a 400 bad request error

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to generate dynamic learning path suggestions through a REST API, so that I can create personalized educational experiences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides learning goals and current skill level THEN the system SHALL return a structured learning path with recommended steps
2. WHEN required parameters are missing THEN the system SHALL return a 400 bad request error with missing field details
3. WHEN the skill level is invalid THEN the system SHALL return a 400 bad request error with valid options
4. WHEN the learning goals are too vague THEN the system SHALL request more specific information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to interact with the AI services through a web frontend, so that I can easily test and demonstrate the functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the frontend THEN the system SHALL display interfaces for all three AI services
2. WHEN a user submits a form for any service THEN the system SHALL show loading states and results
3. WHEN an API call fails THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
4. WHEN results are returned THEN the system SHALL format and display them clearly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to use OpenRouter for OpenAI API access, so that I can manage API usage and costs effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system makes API calls THEN it SHALL use OpenRouter as the proxy to OpenAI
2. WHEN the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is set THEN the system SHALL use it for authentication
3. WHEN the API key is missing THEN the system SHALL fail gracefully with appropriate error messages
4. WHEN API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive API documentation, so that I can understand how to integrate with the microservices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL provide OpenAPI/Swagger documentation at `/docs`
2. WHEN a developer accesses the documentation THEN it SHALL include all endpoints with request/response examples
3. WHEN environment setup is needed THEN the README SHALL provide clear installation and configuration instructions
4. WHEN testing the APIs THEN a Postman collection SHALL be available for import
